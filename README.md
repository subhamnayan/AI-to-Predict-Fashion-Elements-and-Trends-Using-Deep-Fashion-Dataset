# AI-to-Predict-Fashion-Elements-and-Trends-Using-Deep-Fashion-Dataset

Abstract
This study focuses on the development of a machine learning model to analyse fashion trends from various fashion retailers using images from their websites. The DeepFashion dataset and images collected from fashion retailers' websites are used to train the machine learning model. The effectiveness of the model is tested by predicting the sale-through rates of provided images using previous images. The results are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of machine learning models for analysing fashion trends and predicting sales in the fashion industry and have implications for marketing and business strategies for fashion retailers.

I. Introduction:
This research aims to use the DeepFashion dataset to develop a machine learning model that can analyse fashion trends from various fashion retailers. The model will be trained on images collected from the websites of fashion retailers, and its effectiveness will be tested by predicting the sale-through rates of provided images using previous images.

II. Research Design:
The research design for this study involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Collect images from the websites of various fashion retailers. These images will be used to train the machine learning model.
Data Pre-processing: Pre-process the collected images to ensure that they are of uniform size and quality. This will involve resizing, cropping, and adjusting the colour balance of the images.
Model Training: Train the machine learning model on the pre-processed images. This will involve selecting appropriate algorithms and hyperparameters to achieve the best results.
Model Testing: Test the effectiveness of the model by predicting the sale-through rates of provided images using previous images.
Evaluation: Evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the model using appropriate metrics.

III. Data Collection:
The DeepFashion dataset will be used as the primary source of fashion-related images. In addition, images will be collected from the websites of various fashion retailers to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse range of images. The collected images will be organized into a dataset and labelled according to the fashion retailer they belong to.


IV. Data Pre-processing:
The collected images will be pre-processed to ensure that they are of uniform size and quality. This will involve resizing, cropping, and adjusting the colour balance of the images. The pre-processed images will then be saved in a format suitable for training the machine learning model.

V. Model Training:
The machine learning model will be trained on the pre-processed images using appropriate algorithms and hyperparameters. The model will be designed to analyse fashion trends from the images and make predictions based on previous sales data. The model will be trained using a portion of the dataset, and the rest will be used for testing and validation.

VI. Model Testing:
The effectiveness of the model will be tested by predicting the sale-through rates of provided images using previous images. The predicted sale-through rates will be compared to the actual sales data to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

VII. Evaluation:
The accuracy and effectiveness of the model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The results of the evaluation will be used to determine the effectiveness of the model and identify areas for improvement.

VIII. Conclusion:
This research aims to develop a machine learning model that can analyse fashion trends from various fashion retailers using images from their websites. The model will be trained on the DeepFashion dataset and images collected from fashion retailers' websites. The effectiveness of the model will be tested by predicting the sale-through rates of provided images using previous images, and the results will be evaluated using appropriate metrics. The findings of this research will contribute to the development of machine learning models for analysing fashion trends and predicting sales in the fashion industry.
